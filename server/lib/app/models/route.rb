# A +Route+ belonging to +Player+. A route has one or more units and moves
# them from _source_ to _target_ via route hops.
#
# Route has such attributes:
# - id (Fixnum)
# - player_id (Fixnum)
# - cached_units (Hash): Hash of units being moved. I.e. {"Mule" => 10}
# - first_hop (Time): time of the first hop
# - arrives_at (Time): arrival time
# - source_id (Fixnum)
# - source_type (Fixnum)
# - source_x (Fixnum)
# - source_y (Fixnum)
#
# All of the source_* attributes are documented in Location#client_attrs.
#
# Route also has current_* and target_* attributes analogous to source_*
# attributes.
#
# When sending to client +Route+ looks like this:
# {
#   :id => +Fixnum+,
#   :player_id => +Fixnum+,
#   :cached_units => +Hash+,
#   :arrives_at => +Time+,
#   :source => +ClientLocation+,
#   :current => +ClientLocation+,
#   :target => +ClientLocation+
# }
