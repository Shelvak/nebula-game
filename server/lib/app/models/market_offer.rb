# Offer in a galaxy market that allows players to trade with each other.
#
# Offers belong to planets, so if planet owner changes, that means that
# offer owner also changes.
# 
# Some of the attributes:
# - to_rate (Float): how much of _to_kind_ resource you want for 1 of 
# _from_kind_ resource.
# - cancellation_shift (Float): how much should we shift MarketRate for this
# resource pair when cancelling this offer.
# - cancellation_amount (Fixnum): _from_amount_ when this offer was created.
# - cancellation_total_amount (Fixnum): amount of _from_kind_ resource at the time
# of this offers creation (without the amount of this offer).
