You can find protocol in app/controllers/*.rb. Each controller has it's actions
documented.

Every message should have an ID in format of: "%.3f-%s" % [Time.now.to_f, rand(1000)]

Actions are delimited by |, i.e. {"action": "player|login"}

If you want to pass custom parameters, pass them in params:
{"action": "player|login", "params": {"name": "test", "pass": "test"}}

Each request should be JSON hash as one line ending with \n
