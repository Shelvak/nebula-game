  <Tips>
    <tip.0>
      Building energy generators on this land will grant you additional energy
      rate bonus.
    </tip.0>
    <tip.1>
      Building construction buildings on a flat land will increase their
      construction speed later.
    </tip.1>
    <tip.2>
      If you're not sure what building or unit does, click on Info icon to 
      learn more.
    </tip.2>
    <tip.3>
      Don't build turrets on rocky ground! They will lose armor and perish
      in battle faster!
    </tip.3>
    <tip.4>
      Look for strong dark ground to build your turrets on. This ground gives
      them additional armor.
    </tip.4>
    <tip.5>
      You can zoom in and out using your mouse wheel or plus/minus signs in
      top-left map corner.
    </tip.5>
    <tip.6>
      When in battle units in your first flank have 70% chance of being hit
      while second flank has only 30%. Keep your important units in second
      flank.
    </tip.6>
    <tip.7>
      You can click blue arrows in unit construction window to skim through
      available units quickly.
    </tip.7>
    <tip.8>
      Occupy planets in battlegrounds and pulsars to get reinforcements,
      victory points and creds.

      <p>Welcome, Commander.</p>
      <p>
        We have landed in this planet in our 
        [reference:Buildings/Mothership.name] and it seems we are not alone. We 
        have set up our defenses but they are draining more energy than our 
        generators can create. This cannot continue for long! 
      </p>
      <p>
        You must build a [reference:Buildings/CollectorT1.name] to fulfill our 
        energy needs. Do not waste time. Do it now!

        Our energy levels are now normal. However it seems we are stuck here. 
        At least for now. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The good thing is that we have spotted nearby ore deposits. We should 
        build a [reference:Buildings/MetalExtractor.name] to draw metal from 
        one of those deposits.

        It seems that our extractors are working properly. However we need more

        and they will be put to good use.

        are half buried. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Still it would be best if you would send team of explorers to check it

        but our scientists have managed to turn it on. He is now a loyal 
        servant! Isn't that wonderful news? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, that research team also brought back some resources with them. 
        Perhaps it would be wise to continue our exploration of that site? You

        capabilities. There is so much raw metal and energy out there! 
      </p>

        of the base.

        We have a problem. Our metal needs are growing and those two 
        MetalExtractors won't keep us running for long. We 
        need to claim another ore site. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately our scouts located one nearby our base. Unfortunately it is 
        guarded by robotic alien creatures. I think we will not be able to 
        avoid combat. As I was told they guard it with their lives. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We must act. Intelligence estimates that 12 
        Troopers will be able to take down the guards. It 
        may take less or more depending on your strategic skills. But we have 
        to take that ore site over. It is crucial to our survival.

        Now that we are up and running with our metal production we can 
        continue to increase its gains. Our scientists claim they can upgrade 
        our metal extraction rates to numbers we never saw before! And I 
        believe them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets upgrade one of our MetalExtractors and see if 
        they can deliver what they promised.

      <p>In your last mission, "[reference:title.8]" you were rewarded with
      some creds. Go and take your reward if you haven't done so already.</p>
      <p>Creds are a useful and powerful tool. They can be spent on various
      tasks like accelerating your constructions, researches and unit
      training. They can even be used for moving buildings or speeding up
      fleets!</p>
      <p>And how do you get more creds? You can buy them from our shop which
      is accessible from N44 menu in bottom-left corner. You can also gain
      them by conquering and holding special battleground planets about which
      you will learn later.</p>
      <p>And you can become a VIP. Becoming a VIP gives you more creds than
      you spend on the VIP service and allows you to use them daily as you
      see fit.</p>
      <p>So go, order your first VIP and be rewarded greatly!</p>

        Our colony is prospering. We have steady resource income, our troops

        the weather is nice. It's almost like I can call this place home.

        There is only one tiny problem. We must progress forward and having a

        already have a group of our colonists that would apply to work there. 
      </p>

        I highly recommend you order building of a

        think about investing to our military power. Go to your

        useful destroying lightly armored enemy troops. They will help us

        You have already lead quite a few battles yourself. And I see your

        improved their combat skills greatly. They are more effective in 
        battlefield and can withstand more enemy fire if necessary. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest we preserve these skilled warriors and hope we can train

      <p>Hello, Commander.</p>
      <p>
        We have built our [reference:Buildings/SpaceFactory.name]. Now we need 
        ships to travel space. Unfortunately we cannot rely only on our 
        [reference:Units/Mule.name] class transporter ships. They are strongly 
        armored however without any offensive power they will be ripped apart 
        in seconds by alien ships hovering planets and other objects in our 
        solar system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We need combat ships to counter them. Go to your 
        [reference:Buildings/SpaceFactory.name] and order construction now.

      <p>There are some alien dirac ships hovering nearby planet. I suggest
      we take our fleet and wipe them out. That planet looks like a nice

      We should clean it up.</p>
      <p>Why the frowned face? Oh, I must have forgot to mention that those

        planet. However it is guarded by alien ships.

        Use fleet you just built to annex that planet and take over its

      <p>
        Oh, and I suggest we take as many resources as we can with that

        We now have plenty of space in our new colony. After establishing an

      </p>
      <p>
        Build a [reference:Buildings/Radar.name]. It will reveal a sector of

      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that running a [reference:Buildings/Radar.name] requires 
        substantial amount of energy. It will drain your energy storage quickly 
        if you do not have enough energy generated. And if it runs out of 
        energy - it will simply shut down keeping you blind from enemy actions.

        Weakest unit from alien ground army. They are pretty weak and 
        vulnerable and their lasers do not do much damage. However they tend to 
        be in large groups thus compensating their weakness with their 
        quantities. 
      </p>

    <Glancer.name ref="Objects/Glancer" />
    <Glancer.about>
      <p>
        Highly vulnerable but deadly to infantry. Their sniper rifles pierce 
        through light armor. It is better to dispose of Glancers quickly 
        however their tendency to hide behind other units makes them hard 
        targets.

    <Spudder.name ref="Objects/Spudder" />
    <Spudder.about>
      <p>
        Semi-heavy humanoid robots. Armed with homing plasma particles they are 
        a considerable threat for your troops. They fire multiple particles at 
        once making them excellent troops against groups of weak opponents.

    <Gnawer.name ref="Objects/Gnawer" />
    <Gnawer.about>
      <p>
        Guardians of most sacred artifacts in alien buildings. They are fierce 
        killing machines destined to annihilate anyone who trespasses their 
        ground. Highly armored hulls make them hard to destroy and their 
        massive cannons offer versatility against infantry or tanks. 
      </p>

    <Dirac.name ref="Objects/Dirac" />
    <Dirac.about>
      <p>
        These fast vessels were built as quick attackers in assault fleets. 
        However today they can only be found in small groups all over Nebula 44 
        lurking in one place and attacking anyone who approaches their vicinity 
        - may it be friend or foe. 
      </p>
    </Dirac.about>

    <Thor.name ref="Objects/Thor" />
    <Thor.about>
      <p>
        These highly armored but fairly weak ships were used as a front line 
        live shields long time ago. However now they are mostly scattered alone 
        or with small groups of Diracs whom they still protect. 
      </p>
      <p>If you get a grasp on few of these ships know that they are pretty
      useful in air to ground bombardment of your enemy ground forces.</p>
    </Thor.about>

    <Demosis.name ref="Objects/Demosis" />
    <Demosis.about>
      <p>
        These gigantic ships wander around in Nebula 44. Once built for great 
        conquest now their simple robotic minds wait for orders from masters 
        who are long gone. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But beware of their massive armor and weapons. Their laser is slow and 
        requires some time to recharge but packs a powerful punch that is able 
        to take down whole ships in a few shots. 
      </p>
    </Demosis.about>

    <Trooper.name ref="Objects/Trooper" />
    <Trooper.about>
      <p>
        Basic warriors of our armies armed with machine guns. They fearlessly 
        run into battlefield bringing fear into our enemy hearts and confidence 
        into our allies. Even if not very tough they can prove very useful in 
        numbers. 
      </p>
    </Trooper.about>

    <Shocker.name ref="Objects/Shocker" />
    <Shocker.about>
      <p>
        Highly armored field warriors with the capabilities to withstand enemy 
        troop fire. Their rocket launchers are designed to counter more heavily 
        armored opponents but massive shockers still work as best shields for 
        your other anti-infantry units.

    <Seeker.name ref="Objects/Seeker" />
    <Seeker.about>
      <p>
        Armed with [reference:InfoScreen/gun.sniper_rifle] they are lethal to 
        lightly armored enemy units. Although deadly Seekers are very fragile 
        and must be covered well behind the backs of other units or they will 
        perish very quickly.

      <p>
        Scorpion class tanks are basic ground warfare vehicles. They pack a 
        heavy punch with their [reference:InfoScreen/gun.cannon]. Scorpions are 
        quite strong and armored and can take many enemy lives before giving up 
        their own.

    <Azure.name ref="Objects/Azure" />
    <Azure.about>
      <p>
        Azure hovertanks are best way of countering enemy tanks. Their twin 
        rocket launchers on each side barrages battlefield with missiles 
        devastating everything in their path. Hovertank technology stabilizes 
        Azure while it's firing but makes it vulnerable to enemy shots so it 
        should be shielded by other units. 
      </p>

    <Zeus.name ref="Objects/Zeus" />
    <Zeus.about>
      <p>These massive tanks fortify themselves into the ground and shoot their

      <p>
        Mobile Deployable Headquarters (MDH) is used as first and primary base 
        upon foreign colony. This massive vehicle deploys into a fully 
        operational base with building construction capabilities, storage 
        containers and even brings a small 
        [reference:Buildings/MetalExtractor.name] and energy source.

        Beware! Although massive and big it is very fragile while undeployed. 
        Do not let it get into battlefield or it will be damaged beyond repair 
        very soon.

    <Mule.name ref="Objects/Mule" />
    <Mule.about>
      <p>
        Slow and heavily armored transport unit. Its massive hull protects the 
        cargo inside and allows deploying troops onto enemy battlefield even 
        upon heavy fire.

    <Crow.name ref="Objects/Crow" />
    <Crow.about>

        Light, fast and versatile basic combat spaceship. Perfect for quick 
        skirmishes and attacking lone enemy transporters.

    <Cyrix.name ref="Objects/Cyrix" />
    <Cyrix.about>
      <p>
        Cyrix class battleships are standard combat ships used in our fleets. 
        Their sturdy armor and formidable lasers vanquish our enemies whilst 
        Cyrixes wade through space in their pride. Sometimes they are also used 
        as shields for weaker ships like [reference:Dart.name] or 
        [reference:Avenger.name]. 
      </p>
    </Cyrix.about>

    <Rhyno.name ref="Objects/Rhyno" />
    <Rhyno.about>
      <p>
        Rhyno battlecruisers are flagships of any fleet. With their huge 
        defences they can withstand massive fire and their array of weapons 
        makes them strong against multiple types of enemies. However they are 
        costly and their size makes them slow in travel. 
      </p>
    </Rhyno.about>

    <Dart.name ref="Objects/Dart" />
    <Dart.about>
      <p>
        Dart class ships were built specifically to counter 
        [reference:Crow.name] and [reference:Avenger.name] class ships. They 
        are fast and carry weapons deadly to those ships however they lack any 
        solid protection from enemy fire. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They are best at hit and run attacks where they outnumber enemy to 
        destroy them quickly and without casualties. 
      </p>
    </Dart.about>

    <Avenger.name ref="Objects/Avenger" />
    <Avenger.about>
      <p>
        Avengers are deadly against heavily armored ships. Their armor piercing 
        rockets drill through and explode inside enemy ship hulls causing 
        massive damage. Avenger fast engines ensure they can intercept 
        [reference:Cyrix.name] and [reference:Rhyno.name] class ships easily 
        and damage them severely. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However if Avengers are left in the battlefield they can suffer very 
        quickly because they lack any kind of solid protection from enemy fire. 
      </p>

    <Jumper.name ref="Objects/Jumper" />
    <Jumper.about>
      <p>
        Jumpers are lightning fast satellites that are
        used mainly for intelligence missions launched onto enemy
        planets. However because they were engineered for speed they lack
        any protection or guns and cannot sustain even lightest enemy fire.
