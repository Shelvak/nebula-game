      </p>
      <p>
        Intelligence estimates that an alien [obj:1:Unit_Gnat] is of the same

        This wonderful day is perfect for laying ground for our future.
        [reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name] would be a great start. We

        We do not want to make them wait, do we?
      </p>
      <p>
        My recommendation? You should order construction of a

        Our scouts located interesting object nearby. It seems to be remains of

        making a fair assessment of the finding and only reported that they had
        found "some bones".

        Our scouts have detected a few strange buildings guarded by alien robots. 
        They managed to take some samples of the material lying around them and
        our researchers were working on the samples for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that those buildings are full of zetium, a new crystal material.
        Looks like it is very useful and can be used in many ways, even 
        interstellar space travel. We need those crystals! 
      </p>
      <p>
         Its about time the crystals are freed of the alien heels. Order our

        I'm afraid I've miscalculated when saying "there can't be too much of
        resources". Our analytics have presented me with a plan of resource
        extraction and energy production rates covering a few cycles. According
        to their prognosis we won't be able to consume everything we are currently
        producing. Although it may sound as bad news, in fact it is not. All we have
        to do is build some additional storage buildings to store excess resources.

         other solar systems with unoccupied planets exist. Our strategists say
         that one more planet would be of a great use for us. However, to
         colonise it we need some special equipment that can only be produced
         in a [obj:1:Building_GroundFactory::dc].
      </p>
      <p>
        So do not hesitate. Begin researching [obj:1:Technology_GroundFactory]
        technology immediately.

        We already have a ground factory. We now require [obj:1:Technology_Mdh]
        technology, or [obj:1:Unit_Mdh] for short. The [obj:1:Unit_Mdh] had
        already been deployed in our second planet once we arrived there.
        However that probably is only a fortunate coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the travel will take a great deal of time it would be
        unpleasant if an [obj:1:Unit_Mdh] wasn't already on the planet.
        So our own unit will come in handy since we want to colonise that
        third planet.

        The [obj:1:Technology_Mdh] technology is now at our disposal. The only
        thing left for us to do is fly to another solar system and take control
        of a third planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use your [obj:1:Building_GroundFactory::dc] to build an [obj:1:Unit_Mdh]
        unit. Load that unit to a [obj:1:Unit_Mule] class ship and send it to a
        third planet along with an escort. Do not forget to bring along some
        ground troops - the planet will probably be guarded by alien forces.

      <p>
        Research new extractor technologies and build those advanced extractors

      <p>In your last mission you were rewarded with
      some creds. Go and take your reward if you haven't done so already.</p>
      <p>Creds are a useful and powerful tool. They can be spent on various
      tasks like accelerating your constructions, researches and unit
      training. They can even be used for moving buildings or speeding up
      fleets!</p>
      <p>And how do you get more creds? You can buy them from our shop which
      is accessible from N44 menu in bottom-left corner. You can also gain
      them by conquering and holding special battleground planets about which
      you will learn later.</p>
      <p>And you can become a VIP. Becoming a VIP gives you more creds than
      you spend on the VIP service and allows you to use them daily as you
      see fit.</p>
      <p>So go, order your first VIP and be rewarded greatly!</p>

      <p>I suggest we accelerate construction of any building. There are
      plenty of different buildings we will need sooner of later. Speed up
      their construction with creds.</p>

        Weakest unit from alien ground army. They are pretty weak and

        Highly vulnerable but deadly to infantry. Their sniper rifles pierce

        But beware of their massive armor and weapons. Their laser is slow and

        Cyrix class battleships are standard combat ships used in our fleets. 
        Their sturdy armor and formidable lasers vanquish our enemies whilst

        Rhyno battlecruisers are flagships of any fleet. With their huge

      <p>
        Avengers are deadly against heavily armored ships. Their armor piercing 
        rockets drill through and explode inside enemy ship hulls causing 
        massive damage. Avenger fast engines ensure they can intercept 
        [reference:Cyrix.name] and [reference:Rhyno.name] class ships easily 
        and damage them severely.
