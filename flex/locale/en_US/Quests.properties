1.title=The Beginning
1.about=Welcome, Commander.\n\
\n\
We have landed in this planet in our [reference:Buildings/Mothership.name] and \
it seems we are not alone. We have set up our defenses but they are draining \
more energy than our generators can create. This cannot continue for long!\n\
\n\
You must build a [reference:Buildings/CollectorT1.name] to fulfill our energy \
needs. Do not waste time. Do it now!

2.title=Warming Up
2.about=I see you did well, Commander.\n\
\n\
Our energy levels are now normal. However it seems we are stuck here. At least \
for now.\n\
\n\
The good thing is that we have spotted nearby ore deposits. We should build \
a [reference:Buildings/MetalExtractor.name] to draw metal from one of those \
deposits.\n\
\n\
Our future rests in your hands, Commander.

3.title=Growing Needs
3.about=Hello, Commander.\n\
\n\
It seems that our extractors are working properly. However we need \
more resources to keep our growth steady. Build two more resource extractors \
and they will be put to good use.

22.title=Interesting Discoveries
22.about=Good day, Commander!\n\
\n\
Our scouts located interesting object nearby. It seems to be remains of some \
giant animal. Unfortunately only bones are left now and even those are half \
buried.\n\
\n\
Still it would be best if you would send team of explorers to check it out. \
Perhaps they can find something useful there.

23.title=Spoils of Curiosity
23.about=Wonderful news!\n\
\n\
Remember that research expedition you sent out recently? They are back and \
they brought an alien robot with them! Of course it's a bit damaged but \
our scientists have managed to turn it on. He is now a loyal servant! Isn't \
that wonderful news?\n\
\n\
Oh, that research team also brought back some resources with them. Perhaps \
it would be wise to continue our exploration of that site? You never know what \
you might find there... It could prove very useful.

4.title=Getting More
4.about=It is good to see you, Commander.\n\
\n\
Our resource production is steady now. As wonderfull as it is I cannot get it \
out of my head that we aren't pushing to the limits of our capabilities. There \
is so much raw metal and energy out there!\n\
\n\
Call me greedy if you want, but I suggest we should upgrade our extractors. \
Surplus resources never hurt anyone, did they?

5.title=Getting More. Even More.
5.about=Hello again, Commander.\n\
\n\
I see you have listened to my advice and upgraded our resource extractors. \
Do not stop here and invest even more into them. It will be rewarded in time.\n\
\n\
See you soon!

6.title=Unrest
6.about=Hurry!\n\
\n\
Our scouts report hearing strange noises in the wind and our scanners \
are reading strange anomalies. I fear we are not alone. Our defence perimeter \
may not be sufficient for keeping whatever is out there out of the base.\n\
\n\
We need troops. Order construction of [reference:Buildings/Barracks.name] now.\n\
\n\
Our people need to feel safe.

7.title=Arming Up
7.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
Construction of your [reference:Buildings/Barracks.name] is complete as you \
ordered. A few men have volunteered to become our first \
[reference:Objects/Trooper2] but their numbers are low. They will not save us \
if someone attacks.\n\
\n\
We need to have trained personnel that is able to defend us. Order training of \
[reference:Objects/Trooper2] in our [reference:Buildings/Barracks.name].

StrenghteningForces.title=Strenghtening Forces
StrenghteningForces.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
I watch as you grow fierce and strong. But you must not stop here. You must \
go on. Increase our army strength. Make your enemies tremble in fear!

8.title=First Encounter
8.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
We have a problem. Our metal needs are growing and those two \
[reference:Objects/MetalExtractor2] won't keep us running for long. We need to \
claim another ore site.\n\
\n\
Fortunately our scouts located one nearby our base. Unfortunately it is \
guarded by robotic alien creatures. I think we will not be able to avoid \
combat. As I was told they guard it with their lives.\n\
\n\
We must act. Intelligence estimates that 12 [reference:Objects/Trooper2] will \
be able to take down the guards. It may take less or more depending on your \
strategic skills. But we have to take that ore site over. It is crucial to our \
survival.\n\
\n\
We trust in you, Commander.

32.title=Fruits of Bravery
32.about=Great news!\n\
\n\
We have claimed that ore site! We are free to build and upgrade a \
[reference:Buildings/MetalExtractor.name] there. I suggest you do it now. \
Those resources will surely be used by our people.

9.title=Loathing on Metal
9.about=Commander, it is nice to see you!\n\
\n\
Now that we are up and running with our metal production we can continue to \
increase its gains. Our scientists claim they can upgrade our metal extraction \
rates to numbers we never saw before! And I believe them.\n\
\n\
Lets upgrade one of our [reference:Objects/MetalExtractor2] and see if they \
can deliver what they promised.

10.title=Loathing on Energy
10.about=Great news!\n\
\n\
Folks at our science department say they found a way to boost our energy \
production levels! They just need a little investment, thats all.\n\
\n\
Lets give them those resources and I am sure we will get a lot more back than \
we gave. Order upgrading one of [reference:Objects/CollectorT12] now!

11.title=Unresting Minds
11.about=Hello again, Commander.\n\
\n\
Our colony is prospering. We have steady resource income, our troops are \
strong and fearless, our people feel safe and last but not least - the \
weather is nice. It's almost like I can call this place home.\n\
\n\
There is only one tiny problem. We must progress forward and having \
a [reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name] would be a great plus. We already \
have a group of our colonists that would apply to work there.\n\
\n\
I highly recommend you order building of a \
[reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name] in this planet. After all, one or two \
tricks from the science fun bag won't hurt us, will it?

24.title=Things Around Us
24.about=Now that we have a [reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name] a lot \
more scientists are eager to explore. Our scouts have discovered other \
interesting objects in this planet and we have people burning to go there.\n\
\n\
I suggest we try exploring those objects. I am certain there is more to \
discover.

25.title=Useful Discoveries
25.about=Well, that was unexpected!\n\
\n\
Bringing a bunch of those alien robots really made the crowd crazy in our, \
ehrm, excuse me, jar-head lab. They demand they mount an even bigger expedition \
to another object. They say they found some references that they might find \
one of these [reference:Units/Glancer.name] robots down there. And that would \
certainly prove useful to us.\n\
\n\
I say let them go. Order an exploration mission.

26.title=Thirst for Knowledge
26.about=They are out of their minds!\n\
\n\
Our scientists want to mount yet another expedition. To the huge mountain out \
there. However it requires a lot of personnel and we probably don't have \
enough right now.\n\
\n\
We need to upgrade our [reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name]. Beware that \
while upgrading you won't be able to research any technologies. However you \
will still be able to send exploration missions.\n\
\n\
It is up to you, Commander.

12.title=Strength in Shadows
12.about=Greetings, Commander.\n\
\n\
Now that we have a [reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name] we should think \
about investing to our military power. Go to your \
[reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name] and order research on \
[reference:Technologies/Seeker.name]. These advanced warriors are very useful \
destroying lightly armored enemy troops. They will help us greatly in battles \
against alien robots.\n\
\n\
After researching that technology I suggest we should build at least several \
of these great warriors.

13.title=Great Warriors
13.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
You have already lead quite a few battles yourself. And I see your progress. \
Perhaps you have noticed that few of our men also have improved their combat \
skills greatly. They are more effective in battlefield and can withstand more \
enemy fire if necessary.\n\
\n\
I suggest we preserve these skilled warriors and hope we can train more. Do \
not let them die. These are great warriors. We need them alive.

ThirstForKnowledge.title=Thirst For Knowledge
ThirstForKnowledge.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
Important discoveries awaits us! Our enemies may build more fleets but we will \
build better ones! Invest into our research and see that it is worth its price.

27.title=Shards of Technology
27.about=Commander!\n\
\n\
Our scouts have detected a strange building guarded by alien robots. They \
managed to take some samples of the material lying around it and our \
researchers were working on them for quite some time.\n\
\n\
It seems that this building is full of zetium, a new crystal \
material. Looks like it is very useful and can be used in many ways, \
even interstellar space travel. We need those crystals!\n\
\n\
Go and destroy that building so we could claim them for ourselves.

EchoesOfBattle.title=Echoes Of Battle
EchoesOfBattle.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
There is much unrest in this galaxy. We are peaceful people but others are not \
so willing to share this peaceful bliss of mind. We must defend ourselves from \
their brutal ways and what is the best defense than preemptive first strike?\n\
\n\
And don't forget about those aliens out there too...

14.title=Harnessing The Crystals
14.about=Great!\n\
\n\
You have destroyed the aliens and we can use those crystals. Of course we need \
to research a technology that allows us to mine those crystals.\n\
\n\
Hurry! Go to your [reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name] and order research \
now.

15.title=Fruits of Patience
15.about=Finally!\n\
\n\
Our research on [reference:Technologies/ZetiumExtraction.name] has payed of. \
We are now able to build much needed buildings that will extract precious \
zetium from these crystals.\n\

\n\
Order construction of [reference:Buildings/ZetiumExtractor.name] immediately!

16.title=Achieving Greatness
16.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
As a great leader you have brought us many victories. All your efforts are \
appreciated.\n
\n\
Keep up the good work, Commander.

28.title=More Glory
28.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
Your deeds are most glorious.\n\
\n\
May luck be with you.

29.title=Even More Glory
29.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
All our neighbors know about your skills. You are truly worthy. \
Keep it up!

30.title=Top of the Hill
30.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
You are truly a great leader. Your people thrive and prosper under your \
ruling.\n\
\n\
I Wish best luck in your future affairs, Commander.

33.title=The Unstoppable Force
33.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
You are known in whole sector of this galaxy. Our allies respect you and our \
enemies fear you.\n\
\n\
You are truly unstoppable.

64.title=Mayhem Unleashed
64.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
You are a leader in economy, science and war. Keep this on!

17.title=Saving Every Bit
17.about=Welcome back, Commander.\n\
\n\
Now that we have a sufficient income for all three resource types we need to \
be sure they are not wasted. We need to build some additional storages to \
store excess resources we are not using at the moment.\n\
\n\
Order construction of buildings that store each resource type, Commander.

18.title=Reaching To The Stars
18.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
Our scientists have found a way to use zetium in space travel! This is a \
glorious day! Order them to start researching of \
[reference:Technologies/SpaceFactory.name] now.\n\
\n\
Galaxy awaits us!

19.title=Tools of Travel
19.about=Commander!\n\
\n\
Now that we have [reference:Technologies/SpaceFactory.name] technology we must \
build a [reference:Buildings/SpaceFactory.name] on this planet.\n\
\n\
I suggest you construct on that gray leveled building ground - it looks like \
building on such terrain will save us a lot of time.

31.title=Threatening Space
31.about=Hello, Commander.\n\
\n\
We have built our [reference:Buildings/SpaceFactory.name]. Now we need ships \
to travel space. Unfortunately we cannot rely only on our \
[reference:Units/Mule.name] class transporter ships. They are strongly armored \
however without any offensive power they will be ripped apart in seconds by \
alien ships hovering planets and other objects in our solar system.\n\
\n\
We need combat ships to counter them. Go to your \
[reference:Buildings/SpaceFactory.name] and order construction now.

35.title=Cleansing
35.about=Hello, Commander.\n\
\n\
As we have built our [reference:Buildings/SpaceFactory.name] we should start \
amassing our space fleet right now! As an easy first task go pick on some \
[reference:Objects/Dirac2].

36.title=Boiling Waters
36.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
Your recent activity in this region has made alien ships more cautious. Some \
rumors even tell they are planning a rebellion! Go and destroy their powerful \
[reference:Units/Thor.name] class ships. Show them who rules this galaxy!

37.title=Fire Against Fire
37.about=Greetings, Commander.\n\
\n\
It seems there is no stopping these alien ships. You must strike at their \
strongest spot to make them bow down to your might! It is the only way to \
stop the rebellion!

20.title=Expanding Ground
20.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
Now that we have mastered space travel we should start expanding to other \
planets. Our sensors indicate there is a nearby life supporting planet. \
However it is guarded by alien ships.\n\
\n\
Use fleet you just built to annex that planet and take over its control.\n\
\n\
To annex a planet we must land with our ships on its soil.

21.title=The Second Outpost
21.about=Great job, Commander!\n\
\n\
We now control two planets! We should start building immediately! Load your \
Mobile Deployable Headquarters into our [reference:Units/Mule.name] and \
travel to our new colony.\n\
\n\
Deploy that [reference:Units/Mdh.name] to \
[reference:Buildings/Headquarters.name] and start constructing.\n\
\n\
Oh, and I suggest we take as many resources as we can with that \
[reference:Units/Mule.name] to our new colony. They will prove to be very \
useful there.

34.title=Eye in the Sky
34.about=Commander!\n\
\n\
We now have plenty of space in our new colony. After establishing an \
operational base we should begin exploring our galaxy.\n\
\n\
Build a [reference:Buildings/Radar.name]. It will reveal a sector of galaxy \
map and show other solar systems with ship movement within that sector.\n\
\n\
Keep in mind that running a [reference:Buildings/Radar.name] requires \
substantial amount of energy. It will drain your energy storage quickly if you \
do not have enough energy generated. And if it runs out of energy - it will \
simply shut down keeping you blind from enemy actions.

38.title=Gaining Ground
38.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
It is time to expand your empire. Gain another colony so we could thrive \
there! Make our ancestors proud.

39.title=Expanding Empire
39.about=Good job, Commander.\n\
\n\
Even if we have conquered that pesky world we should not stop with it. There \
is much ground to cover. Go and conquer yet another world. Make it fall to the \
might of our empire!

40.title=Expanding Empire (II)
40.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
I am sure you are happy with our empire. But will you stop at this?

41.title=Expanding Empire (III)
41.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
It is astonishing work you have done! But we need more ground to live on, our \
population is growing. You need to acquire more planets!

42.title=Expanding Empire (IV)
42.about=Commander.\n\
\n\
We have ultimate empire, all our puny neighbors are in fear. I say - lets take \
one more planet from them, just to show them our might. Shall we?

43.title=Corrupting Transport Lines
43.about=Commander.\n\
