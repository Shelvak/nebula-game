CollectorT2.common=These solar collectors are used to provide massive amounts of \
energy to all buildings and construction. By using technology from alien \
[reference:NpcSolarPlant.name]s their massive panels generate a \
formidable amount of energy. Although their advanced designs allow \
upgrading them beyond the limits of their former versions they cost a lot more \
than simple [reference:Objects/CollectorT22].
CollectorT2.about=[reference:CollectorT2.common]\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases energy output.

CollectorT3.name=Thermal Hub
CollectorT3.tooltip=Generates energy
CollectorT3.common=Geothermal vents are as rarely found as they are \
powerful and these hubs allow you to use that power. They are the most \
effective means of generating energy and gives best cost to performance ratio. \
\n\
However this comes at a price: due to origin of their power these hubs are \
weak and easily destroyed. However if you can defend it well, it prove to be \
greatly useful to you.
CollectorT3.about=[reference:CollectorT3.common]\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases energy output.

EnergyStorage.name=Energy Batteries

liquid. This is the only form allowing for later reuse of the material, \
however it is highly unstable and even slightest distortion could leave \
nothing behind. Because of that when building these storages distance is \
kept from all other buildings.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases storage.

Radar.name=Radar
Radar.tooltip=Increases visible galaxy area
Radar.common=These massive buildings are used for deep space telemetry. As they \
