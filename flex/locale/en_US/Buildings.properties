abandoned long time ago by their true owners. By now only hollow shell \
remains. However be cautious because the guardians are still there.

NpcZetiumExtractor.name=Warehouse
NpcZetiumExtractor.about=It seems that zetium was stored in these strange \
warehouses. Scans indicate that there is no zetium inside now but we detect \
multiple signatures of alien lifeforms there.

NpcGeothermalPlant.name=Heat Collector 
NpcGeothermalPlant.about=Built ages ago these buildings were probably meant as \
collectors for geothermal heat that is hidden below them. Defeat guardians of \
this place and use that power for yourself!

NpcSolarPlant.name=Prism
NpcSolarPlant.about=Solar power is converted in these buildings. Our scans \
indicate strong energy output and multiple hostile units there. Act with \
caution.

NpcCommunicationsHub.name=CommHub
NpcCommunicationsHub.about=These structures look like some kind of \
communication device. Perhaps they were used to bring messages to other worlds?

NpcTemple.name=Temple
NpcTemple.about=Whilst extremely advanced Precursors were also a deeply \
religious race. They gathered in this building to pray to their gods. The land \
on which it is standing is sacred and heavily guarded.

NpcExcavationSite.name=Excavation Site
NpcExcavationSite.about=It seems like a dig site. Although nobody knows what \
they were searching for it is still guarded by hostile units.

NpcResearchCenter.name=Lab
NpcResearchCenter.about=It seems that this is a Precursor research laboratory. \
No one knows what is inside only that outside of it is guarded by swarms of \
robots.

NpcJumpgate.name=Jumpgate
NpcJumpgate.about=These jumpgates were used to warp forces between planets \
crossing solar systems in mere seconds. Even if they do not function anymore \
there is still great defenses set up to forbid strangers from entering its \
vicinity.



Mothership.name=Mothership
Mothership.about=The Mothership is the core ship for humans who inhabit this \
planet. They came here in this ship and used it as their first base \
securing perimeter around with deadly base defense towers. \n\
\n\
Each Mothership has a basic MEX and some solar cells integrated in it \
and can provide a colony with core metal and energy needs.

MetalExtractor.name=MEX
MetalExtractor.about=Built on ore mountains they are used to extract metal \
from dirt and rumble. Metal Extractors (MEXes) are facilities that provide \
metal one require by eating up through mountains and bringing its ore supplies \
up to the surface.\n\
\n\
Each MEX can be upgraded to increase it's effectiveness and extract more \
metal. However by doing so it also requires more energy to operate.\n\
\n\
MEXes will shut down if you do not have energy to run them.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases metal extraction rate.

MetalStorage.name=Metal Storage
MetalStorage.about=As MEXes rip through the ore not all metal is used up \
immediately. Excess metal is stored in these giant structures. When the time \
comes it is released from these containers and used in construction of our \
fleets and buildings.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases storage.

SolarPlant.name=Collector
SolarPlant.about=These solar collectors are used to provide basic needs of \
energy to all buildings and construction. Their massive panels generate a \
formidable amount of energy. However due to their technological limitations \
upgrading them is a costly and hard work that does not bring much rewards.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases energy output.

WindPanel.name=Wind panel
WindPanel.about=Although smaller in size and not as effective at first these \
panels can harness the power of wind bringing a moderate amount of energy. \
Even if the first levels are not too impressive these panels are superior in \
technology. Upgrading them gives a big boost and allows them to outperform \
solar collectors in later levels.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases energy output.

GeothermalPlant.name=Thermal Hub
GeothermalPlant.about=Geothermal vents are as rarely found as they are \
powerful and these hubs allow you to use that power. They are the most \
effective means of generating energy and gives best cost to performance ratio. \
\n\
However this comes at a price: due to origin of their power these hubs are \
weak and easily destroyed. However if you can defend it well, it prove to be \
greatly useful to you.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases energy output.

EnergyStorage.name=Energy batteries
EnergyStorage.about=These large batteries keep vast amounts of excess energy \
to be used later. Due to their massiveness most of the structure are buried \
underground thus giving sufficient protection from enemy attacks.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases energy storage.

Barracks.name=Barracks
Barracks.about=Finest men are trained here to do battle in our cause. They \
undergo best physical and mental training there are and are equipped by \
powerfull combat suits and weapons to aid them in combat.

ResearchCenter.name=Research Center
ResearchCenter.about=Greatest minds of each planet work here to bring \
technological advancements to our civilization. Do notice that even if these \
researches often require much resources and manpower to bring visions alive \
they are well proven to be worth the cost. \n\
\n\
It is essential that you have at least one of these research centers \
or your opponents will eventually overtake you with their superior \
technology.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases number of available scientists.

ZetiumExtractor.name=Zetium Extractor
ZetiumExtractor.about=Zetium is a rare crystal that has incredible properties. \
Combined with technologies it allows for making of great buildings, \
ships and weapons. These crystals are also essential to our space engines \
and most other advanced technologies.\n\
\n\
Zetium extractors will shut down if you do not have energy to run them.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases zetium extraction rate.

ZetiumStorage.name=Zetium Storage
ZetiumStorage.about=After extracting zetium crystals are melted and stored as \
liquid. This is the only form allowing for later reuse of the material, \
however it is highly unstable and even slightest distortion could leave \
nothing behind. Because of that when building these storages distance is \
kept from all other buildings.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases storage.

Radar.name=Radar
Radar.about=These massive buildings are used for deep space telemetry. As they \
drain energy from our generators they can see planets in our and other solar \
systems. Furthermore it even registers fleet movements in galaxy and solar \
systems giving us insight at what is happening in our neighborhood.\n\
\n\
Each upgrade level increases distance it can see.

ResourceTransporter.name=TODO: Resource transporter
ResourceTransporter.about=Teleport resources with this one

Headquarters.name=Headquarters
Headquarters.about=Deployed from Mobile Deployable Headquarters it is the first \
outpost in a foreign colony. Provided with enough metal and energy for initial \
construction it is the seed from which a thriving colony grows.\n\
\n\
Headquarters allow you to construct buildings.

Vulcan.name=Vulcan
Vulcan.about=Defensive stationary turret especially effective against lightly \
armored units. Equipped with 6 CX-60 high speed cannons it can shed through \
armies quickly dealing enormous damage.\n\
\n\
Only capable of hitting ground units.

Screamer.name=Screamer
Screamer.about=Equipped with twin ROCKO-3 heavy rocket launchers this \
stationary turret is best retaliation against tanks and heavy units.\n\
\n\
Only capable of hitting ground units.

Thunder.name=Thunder
Thunder.about=Firing plasma balls capable of reaching suborbital levels it is \
your best best against enemy crafts and bombers. Its projectiles detonate upon \
impact dealing massive damage.\n\
\n\
Only capable of hitting space units.

GroundFactory.name=Ground Factory
GroundFactory.about=A great technological advancement allowing us to build \
tanks and other advanced ground units.\n\
\n\
One of its most feared creations are Scorpion tanks that are main force in any \
ground attack squad, although other units can also be built here. 

SpaceFactory.name=Space Factory
SpaceFactory.about=From the humble Crow scout class vessel to the great Rhino \
battleship - Space Factory brings it all at your disposal.\n\
\n\
It's facilities allows production of spacecraft that are capable of solar and \
interstellar travel allowing you to expand your empire.
