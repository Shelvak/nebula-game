However! If you want to prevent those pesky Space Bugs from infesting our client ever \
again you could send bits and pieces of nifty information we have collected. We assure \
you we WILL use that to improve our Bug-No-More formula (TM) more effective to \
make your gaming experience as pleasurable as humanly possible ;)\n\

So just copy that text below to clipboard (or press our conveniently placed \
Copy-O-Matic button) and wander to our forum to report this bug. Your hard work \
will be rewarded. We promise. Cosmic pinky swear. Oh yeah...

We could fix this however unfortunately you do not have debugger \
version of Flash Player so we can't collect \
much useful information. You could still report this bug but it probably won't do \
us much good. If you DO WANT to prevent this from happening ever again then \
click the [reference:label.clientCrash.wiki] button to get more information on \
how you can help us ;) We appreciate your help!
