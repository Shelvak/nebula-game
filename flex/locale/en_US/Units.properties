Gnat.name=Gnat
Gnat.about=Weakest unit from alien ground army. They are pretty weak and \
vulnerable and their lasers do not do much damage. However they tend to be in
large groups thus compensating their weakness with their quantities.\n\
\n\
They are usually found near resource deposits and are best dealt with the \
help of light infantry.

Glancer.name=Glancer
Glancer.about=Highly vulnerable but deadly to infantry. Their sniper \
rifles pierce through light armor. It is better to dispose of Glancers quickly \
however their tendency to hide behind other units makes them hard targets.\n\
\n\
It is best to deal with them by using anti-infantry weapons.

Spudder.name=Spudder
Spudder.about=Semi-heavy humanoid robots. Armed with homing plasma particles \
they are a considerable threat for your troops. They fire multiple particles \
at once making them excellent troops against groups of weak opponents. \n\
\n\
Because their thick armor protects them from light weapons they are best \
dealt with when outnumbered by Shockers or a few Scorpions.

Gnawer.name=Gnawer
Gnawer.about=Guardians of most sacred artifacts in alien buildings. They are \
fierce killing machines destined to annihilate anyone who trespasses their \
ground. Highly armored hulls make them hard to destroy and their massive \
cannons offer versatility against infantry or tanks.

Dirac.name=Dirac
Dirac.about=These fast vessels were built as quick attackers in assault \
fleets. However today they can only be found in small groups all over \
Nebula 44 lurking in one place and attacking anyone who approaches their \
vicinity - may it be friend or foe.

Thor.name=Thor
Thor.about=These highly armored but fairly weak ships were used as a front \
line live shields long time ago. However now they are mostly scattered alone \
or with small groups with [reference:Objects/Dirac2] whom they still protect.

Demosis.name=Demosis
Demosis.about=These gigantic ships wander around in Nebula 44. Once built for \
great conquest now their simple robotic minds wait for orders from masters who \
are long gone.\n\
\n\
But beware of their massive armor and weapons. Their laser is slow and requires \
some time to recharge but packs a powerful punch that is able to take down \
whole ships in a few shots.

Trooper.name=Trooper
Trooper.about=Basic warriors of our armies armed with machine guns. They \
fearlessly run into battlefield bringing fear into our enemy hearts and \
confidence into our allies. Even if not very tough they can prove very useful \
in numbers.

Shocker.name=Shocker
Shocker.about=Highly armored field warriors with the capabilities to withstand \
enemy troop fire. Their rocket launchers are designed to counter more heavily \
armored opponents but massive shockers still work as best shields for your \
other anti-infantry units.

Seeker.name=Seeker
Seeker.about=Armed with [reference:InfoScreen/gun.sniper_rifle] they are \
lethal to lightly armored enemy units. Although deadly Seekers are very \
fragile and must be covered well behind the backs of other units or they \
will perish very quickly.

Spy.name=Spy
Spy.about=Explore your enemies

Saboteur.name=Saboteur
Saboteur.about=Is likely to ruin things

Scorpion.name=Scorpion
Scorpion.about=Scorpion class tanks are basic ground warfare vehicles. \
They pack a heavy punch with their [reference:InfoScreen/gun.cannon]. \
Scorpions are quite strong and armored and can take many enemy lives before \
giving up their own.

Azure.name=Azure
Azure.about=Azure hovertanks are best way of countering enemy tanks. Their \
twin rocket launchers on each size barrages battlefield with missiles \
devastating everything in their path. Hovertank technology stabilizes Azure \
while it's firing but makes it vulnerable to enemy shots so it should be \
shielded by other units.

Mdh.name=MDH
Mdh.common=Mobile Deployable Headquarters (MDH) is used as first and primary \
base upon foreign colony. This massive vehicle deploys into a fully \
operational base with building construction capabilities, storage containers \
and even brings a small [reference:Buildings/MetalExtractor.name] and \
energy source.
Mdh.about=[reference:Mdh.common]\n\
\n\
Beware! Although massive and big it is very fragile while undeployed. Do not \
let it get into battlefield or it will be damaged beyond repair very soon.

Mule.name=Mule
Mule.about=Slow and heavily armored transport unit. Its massive hull protects \
the cargo inside and allows deploying troops onto enemy battlefield even upon \
heavy fire.

Crow.name=Crow
Crow.about=Light, fast and versatile basic combat spaceship. Perfect for \
quick skirmishes and attacking lone enemy transporters.

Cyrix.name=Cyrix
Cyrix.about=Cyrix class battleships are standard combat ships used in our \
fleets. Their sturdy armor and formidable lasers vanquish our enemies whilst \
Cyrixes wade through space in their pride. Sometimes they are also used as \
shields for weaker ships like [reference:Dart.name] or [reference:Avenger.name].

Rhyno.name=Rhyno
Rhyno.about=Rhyno battlecruisers are flagships of any fleet. With their huge \
defences they can withstand massive fire and their array of weapons makes them \
strong against multiple types of enemies. However they are costly and their \
size makes them slow in travel.

Dart.name=Dart
Dart.about=Dart class ships were built specifically to counter \
[reference:Crow.name] and [reference:Avenger.name] class ships. They are \
fast and carry weapons deadly to those ships however they lack any solid \
protection from enemy fire.\n\
\n\
They are best at hit and run attacks where they outnumber enemy to destroy \
them quickly and without casualties.

Avenger.name=Avenger
Avenger.about=Avengers are deadly against heavily armored ships. Their armor \
piercing rockets drill through and explode inside enemy ship hulls causing \
massive damage. Avenger fast engines ensure they can intercept \
[reference:Cyrix.name] and [reference:Rhyno.name] class ships easily and \
damage them severely.\n\
\n\
However if Avengers are left in the battlefield they can suffer very quickly \
because they lack any kind of solid protection from enemy fire.
