        Save yourselves! Mighty Space Bugs have infested our game client and 
        sadly it is not Space Bug Resistant! (yet) Oh well, don't worry, you 
        can always just press Refresh button on your browser and everything 
        will be fine (probably).

        However! If you want to prevent those pesky Space Bugs from infesting 
        our client ever again you could send bits and pieces of nifty 
        information we have collected. We assure you we WILL use that to 
        improve our Bug-No-More formula (TM) more effective to make your gaming 
        experience as pleasurable as humanly possible ;)

      <p>
        So just copy that text below to clipboard (or press our conveniently 
        placed Copy-O-Matic button) and wander to our forum to report this bug. 
        Your hard work will be rewarded. We promise. Cosmic pinky swear. Oh

        We could fix this however unfortunately you do not have debugger 
        version of Flash Player so we can't collect much useful information. If 
        you DO WANT to prevent this from happening ever again then click the

      <p>Welcome, Commander.</p>

        We have landed in this planet in our 
        [reference:Buildings/Mothership.name] and it seems we are not alone. We 
        have set up our defenses but they are draining more energy than our

        You must build a [reference:Buildings/CollectorT1.name] to fulfill our

        At least for now. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The good thing is that we have spotted nearby ore deposits. We should 
        build a [reference:Buildings/MetalExtractor.name] to draw metal from

        Oh, that research team also brought back some resources with them.

        We have a problem. Our metal needs are growing and those two 
        [reference:Objects/MetalExtractor2] won't keep us running for long. We 
        need to claim another ore site. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately our scouts located one nearby our base. Unfortunately it is 
        guarded by robotic alien creatures. I think we will not be able to 
        avoid combat. As I was told they guard it with their lives. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We must act. Intelligence estimates that 12 
        [reference:Objects/Trooper2] will be able to take down the guards. It 
        may take less or more depending on your strategic skills. But we have 
        to take that ore site over. It is crucial to our survival.

        There is only one tiny problem. We must progress forward and having a

        already have a group of our colonists that would apply to work there. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I highly recommend you order building of a

        [reference:Units/Glancer.name] robots down there. And that would 
        certainly prove useful to us.

        think about investing to our military power. Go to your 
        [reference:Buildings/ResearchCenter.name] and order research on

        useful destroying lightly armored enemy troops. They will help us 
        greatly in battles against alien robots.

        We have built our [reference:Buildings/SpaceFactory.name]. Now we need 
        ships to travel space. Unfortunately we cannot rely only on our 
        [reference:Units/Mule.name] class transporter ships. They are strongly 
        armored however without any offensive power they will be ripped apart 
        in seconds by alien ships hovering planets and other objects in our 
        solar system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We need combat ships to counter them. Go to your

        planet. However it is guarded by alien ships.

        Use fleet you just built to annex that planet and take over its

      <p>
        Deploy that [reference:Units/Mdh.name] to 
        [reference:Buildings/Headquarters.name] and start constructing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and I suggest we take as many resources as we can with that

        Keep in mind that running a [reference:Buildings/Radar.name] requires

        Recent developments in zetium technology allowed infantry gun ammo to 
        be upgraded with more explosive power. Zetium enhanced bullets and 
        rockets reach greater velocity and bigger impact speed meaning more 
        damage to enemy.

      <p>
        Armed with [reference:InfoScreen/gun.sniper_rifle] they are lethal to 
        lightly armored enemy units. Although deadly Seekers are very fragile 
        and must be covered well behind the backs of other units or they will 
        perish very quickly.

    <Scorpion.about>
      <p>
        Scorpion class tanks are basic ground warfare vehicles. They pack a 
        heavy punch with their [reference:InfoScreen/gun.cannon]. Scorpions are 
        quite strong and armored and can take many enemy lives before giving up 
        their own.

    <Azure.about>
      <p>
        Azure hovertanks are best way of countering enemy tanks. Their twin 
        rocket launchers on each side barrages battlefield with missiles 
        devastating everything in their path. Hovertank technology stabilizes 
        Azure while it's firing but makes it vulnerable to enemy shots so it 
        should be shielded by other units.

        Mobile Deployable Headquarters (MDH) is used as first and primary base 
        upon foreign colony. This massive vehicle deploys into a fully 
        operational base with building construction capabilities, storage 
        containers and even brings a small 
        [reference:Buildings/MetalExtractor.name] and energy source.

      <p>[reference:Mdh.common]</p>
      <p>
        Beware! Although massive and big it is very fragile while undeployed. 
        Do not let it get into battlefield or it will be damaged beyond repair 
        very soon.

      <p>
        Slow and heavily armored transport unit. Its massive hull protects the 
        cargo inside and allows deploying troops onto enemy battlefield even 
        upon heavy fire.

    <Cyrix.name value="Cyrix" />
    <Cyrix.about>
      <p>
        Cyrix class battleships are standard combat ships used in our fleets. 
        Their sturdy armor and formidable lasers vanquish our enemies whilst 
        Cyrixes wade through space in their pride. Sometimes they are also used 
        as shields for weaker ships like [reference:Dart.name] or 
        [reference:Avenger.name].

    <Rhyno.name value="[reference:Objects/Rhyno1]" />
    <Rhyno.about>
      <p>
        Rhyno battlecruisers are flagships of any fleet. With their huge 
        defences they can withstand massive fire and their array of weapons 
        makes them strong against multiple types of enemies. However they are 
        costly and their size makes them slow in travel. 
      </p>
    </Rhyno.about>

    <Dart.name value="[reference:Objects/Dart1]" />
    <Dart.about>
      <p>
        Dart class ships were built specifically to counter 
        [reference:Crow.name] and [reference:Avenger.name] class ships. They 
        are fast and carry weapons deadly to those ships however they lack any 
        solid protection from enemy fire. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They are best at hit and run attacks where they outnumber enemy to 
        destroy them quickly and without casualties. 
      </p>
    </Dart.about>

    <Avenger.name value="[reference:Objects/Avenger1]" />
    <Avenger.about>
      <p>
        Avengers are deadly against heavily armored ships. Their armor piercing 
        rockets drill through and explode inside enemy ship hulls causing 
        massive damage. Avenger fast engines ensure they can intercept 
        [reference:Cyrix.name] and [reference:Rhyno.name] class ships easily 
        and damage them severely. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However if Avengers are left in the battlefield they can suffer very 
        quickly because they lack any kind of solid protection from enemy fire.

    <Jumper.about>
      <p>
        [reference:Objects/Jumper2] are lightning fast satellites that are
        used mainly for intelligence missions launched onto enemy
        planets. However because they were engineered for speed they lack
        any protection or guns and cannot sustain even lightest enemy fire.
